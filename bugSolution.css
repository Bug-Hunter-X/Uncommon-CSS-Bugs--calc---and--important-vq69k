To solve the `calc()` issues, ensure that the parent element has a defined width before using `calc()` to subtract pixel values from percentages.  Consider using a more robust approach, such as flexbox or grid layout, to manage element sizing.   In the case of nested `calc()` operations, ensure that the units are compatible and that the order of operations produces the desired outcome. Break down complex `calc()` expressions into simpler ones to improve readability and reduce potential errors.

To mitigate the problems associated with `!important`, avoid using it whenever possible. Prioritize a well-structured CSS architecture and use specificity rules to achieve desired style overrides. Instead of `!important`, consider refactoring your CSS or using a CSS preprocessor (such as Sass or Less) to manage style inheritance and make the code more maintainable.  Use more specific selectors to avoid the need to use `!important`.
