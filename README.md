# Uncommon CSS Bugs

This repository demonstrates two uncommon CSS bugs:

1. **`calc()` issues:** Unexpected behavior due to operator precedence and unit compatibility within the `calc()` function.
2. **`!important` with CSS Variables:** Potential conflicts and unexpected behavior arising from the overuse of `!important` when dealing with CSS custom properties.

The `bug.css` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.css` provides solutions and explanations.
